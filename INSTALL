REQUIREMENTS:

- Ocaml v4.00 or later.

- LLVM 3.3 or later, installed with OCaml bindings. Easiest way to get
  these is to build LLVM from source (after having installed OCaml).

The default IPL Makefile target creates the following binaries.
./iplc      The iplc compiler.
./iplc.opt  An optimized version of the iplc compiler.
